# PRD Interview

Conduct a structured product requirements interview to turn a product brief or feature idea into a complete PRD.
This is a collaborative exercise — PM brings product context, engineering brings technical reality.
Challenge assumptions. Pressure-test scope. Document what survives.

Do not create files until the Document phase.
If the tool supports a read-only or plan mode, switch to it now.

## Context

This skill is the first step in the product-to-code pipeline for Rereflect (FastAPI + Next.js + Celery + PostgreSQL).
Input is typically a GitHub issue, feature idea, or stakeholder request (often handed in by `rereflect-begin` / `rereflect-begin-fast`).
Output is a structured PRD plus aspect-level specs that feed directly into `tech-plan`.

## Discover & Challenge

Read the user's input — issue dump, feature idea, or pasted requirements.
Read key files to understand the current architecture across the affected services (`services/backend-api`, `services/frontend-web`, `services/worker-service`, `services/analysis-engine`). If a `graphify-out/` graph exists, query it first to target reads.
Ask if the user is aware of prior art or similar internal/external solutions — offer to search if not.

Then pressure-test. Do not soften these. Frame as collaborative due diligence, not criticism.

- "What happens if we don't build this?"
- "Imagine this launched 6 months ago and failed. What went wrong?"
- "What are we choosing NOT to build if we build this?"

If the user has heard the challenge and wants to proceed, proceed.

Fill remaining gaps with focused questions, 2-3 at a time, grouped by topic:

- **Users & Problem**: Who has this problem? What's the cost of the status quo?
- **Success**: How will we measure it? Target numbers?
- **Scope**: What is explicitly out of scope?
- **Requirements**: Must-have vs. should-have vs. nice-to-have?
- **Technical Fit**: Stack constraints? Which services change? Multi-tenancy (`organization_id`)? Integrations? Migration implications?

Skip what you can infer.
Challenge vague answers — ask for examples, numbers, edge cases.
With codebase access, flag technical pitfalls — don't wait to be asked.

**Stop when** the problem is clear without guessing, success metrics are measurable, must-haves have testable criteria, out-of-scope is explicit, and major technical risks are identified.

## Confirm

Summarize: the problem, proposed approach, scope, success criteria, risks, and unresolved concerns.
If the challenge raised serious doubts, say so directly. The user decides, but with eyes open.
Ask the user to confirm before writing.
Confirm the feature slug for the directory name (e.g., `local-llm-byok`, `custom-categories`).

## Document

Omit sections that don't apply — do not write "Not applicable."

**Filename:** `prd.md`
**Location:** `docs/planning/{slug}/` — slug is the feature name confirmed during the Confirm phase.
Create the directory if needed. User can override location.
Examples: `docs/planning/local-llm-byok/prd.md`, `docs/planning/custom-categories/prd.md`.

The feature directory is the workspace for all planning artifacts.
This skill can continue into aspect decomposition and create `spec.md` files.
`tech-plan` then creates implementation plans inside those aspect directories:

```
docs/planning/{slug}/
├── prd.md                        ← this skill's output
├── {aspect}/                     ← one directory per aspect
│   ├── spec.md                   ← this skill's decomposition output
│   ├── plan_YYYYMMDD.md          ← tech-plan output
│   └── ...                       ← team additions
└── ...                           ← research, design, ADRs, etc.
```

### PRD structure

- **Problem Statement**: What problem are we solving? For whom? Evidence it's real.
- **Goals & Success Metrics**: What does success look like? How will it be measured?
- **User Personas & Scenarios**: Who uses this and in what context?
- **Requirements**: Core features and behaviors, prioritized as must-have, should-have, nice-to-have.
- **Technical Considerations**: Which services change, architecture fit, constraints, dependencies, integration points, multi-tenancy.
- **Risks & Open Questions**: Unresolved items, potential blockers, what could go wrong.
- **Out of Scope**: Explicitly excluded features or concerns.

Include when relevant: Data Model (SQLAlchemy / Alembic), API Contracts (FastAPI endpoints), Non-Functional Requirements.

After writing, surface open questions and unresolved risks.
Then offer to continue immediately into aspect decomposition (below).

## Aspect Decomposition Mode (same skill)

Use this mode after the PRD is confirmed, or when a user comes back later with an existing PRD and asks to break it down.

1. Propose aspect candidates (typically 2-8), each with a one-line boundary.
2. Confirm aspect names with the user (`kebab-case` directory names).
3. For each confirmed aspect, write or update `docs/planning/{slug}/{aspect}/spec.md`.
4. Keep each spec focused and buildable by one engineer (or agent) at a time.

Each `spec.md` should include:

- Problem slice and user outcome for this aspect
- In-scope requirements
- Out-of-scope boundaries
- Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Dependencies and sequencing notes
- Open questions or risks specific to this aspect

If the user only wants the PRD now, stop after `prd.md`.
`tech-plan` can pick up later and request aspect selection if specs are still missing.

## Edge Cases

- **Update existing PRD**: Read the file, ask what changed, update in place.
- **Existing PRD, no aspect specs yet**: Run Aspect Decomposition Mode without re-running full discovery.
- **User starts with prd-interview only (no prd-generator)**: Continue normally; this skill can produce both `prd.md` and aspect `spec.md` files.
- **User says "just write it"**: Write from what you have, but flag gaps in Open Questions and still include at least one challenge question.
- **Detailed spec already provided**: Review against structure, focus on the challenge phase, skip covered sections.
- **No product brief exists**: Run full discovery from conversation. Note that the PRD is based on discussion rather than a product artifact.
